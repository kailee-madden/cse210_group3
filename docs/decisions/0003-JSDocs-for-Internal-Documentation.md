# Use JS Docs for our Internal Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement

How should we document our code and our application?
What should we use for internal documentation?

## Considered Options

* No documentation - let the code speak for itself
* JS Docs
* Manually written

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "JS Docs" because it automates the documentation process, forces developers to consider the documentation while writing the code by bringing them together into the same space, and provides a clear format for documentation.
